# House Price Analysis

This project explores the key factors influencing house sale prices through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various property features, including quality, living area, and neighborhood characteristics.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset (`train.csv`) contains essential variables for understanding and modeling house prices:
- **SalePrice**: The final selling price of the house.
- **YearBuilt**: Year the house was constructed.
- **OverallQual** and **OverallCond**: Overall quality and condition ratings.
- **GrLivArea**: Above-ground living area in square feet.
- **Neighborhood**: Location of the property within the city.

## Required Packages
To replicate the analysis, install the following R packages:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "ggcorrplot", "dplyr", "RColorBrewer", "GGally", "kableExtra"))
